# Odin-Etch-a-Sketch
With this project, I've reviewed my Flexbox skills and DOM manipulation.
In this project, I mainly write in Javascript as a way to practise. 
Besides, I reviewed old lessons and also learned something new:
- Reviewed prompt() method
- Reviewed forEach() method
- Review opacity CSS property
- Reviewed Math.random() method
And,
- Learned Math.min() and Math.max() methods
- Learned Number.isNaN() and Number.isInteger()
- Learned parseInt() and parseFloat()
- Leaned a new method: element.getBoundingClientRect() method
    + The element.getBoundingClientRect() has .width and .height properties.

To conclude, I've learned some thing new and re-learned many things. I've also realized that i need to actively search for new things and should not let myself forget old lessons because it might help me come up with a solution faster. Even though it's somewhat disappointed, but i still needed help from others. 

Nevertheless, this project is not easy (at least for me), but I feel like I've grown a little after this. I definitely need to review arrow function and DOM Manipulation (CSS). I also need to practice more on writing commit messages.
